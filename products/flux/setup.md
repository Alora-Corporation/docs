# Setup

The main point of the system is integrations. We've made a few global integrations which can be automatically installed by your system. You can choose which global integrations to install in Config.

To learn how to add global integrations to your system or know how to set them up, refer to the [Global Integrations](global.md) doc.

To learn how to create your own custom integrations, refer to the [Custom Integrations](custom.md) doc.
