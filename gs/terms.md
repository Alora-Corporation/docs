## Section 1: Products

We've wrote our Terms of Use in a **Allowed and Disallowed Uses** format to make them easier to understand.

### What you're allowed to do:

1. **Modify products** and use custom models, as long as the existing brandings remain.
2. **Move brandings**, but they must remain on the product's surface.
3. **Put your own brandings on products**, if you own the No Branding Pass or the product includes the **No Branding surcharge**. Products on sale on the Creator Store are included.
4. **Resell licenses**, but not for more than 50 Robux above the original price.
5. **Make UI modifications**, as long as you follow the Terms of Use and don’t change Parent properties. Deleting existing UI elements may cause the system to error, so delete with caution.

### What you're not allowed to do:

1. **Deobfuscating** or **reverse engineering** any product.
2. **Removing or changing brandings**, unless you own the No Branding Pass.
3. **Claiming ownership** of our products unless permitted.
4. **Using counterfeit products** without a license.
5. **Using leaked products**, especially those resold by others.
6. **Bypassing licensing systems**.
7. **Redistributing product files to others**, even if they already own the product.
8. **Using products illegally** or for unauthorized purposes.
9. **Tampering** with products to falsely show poor condition.
10. **Creating negative or unfair content** using our products (e.g., bad reviews, false comparisons, defamation).
11. **Posting media** to harm sales, boycott, or damage Atelier Group's reputation.
12. **Unfairly reselling licenses** at inflated prices. Don't be a scammer bro.
